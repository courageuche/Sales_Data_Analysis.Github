# Sales_Data_Analysis.Github
A sales data analysis done using Python (Pandas and Matplotlib).
I carried an analysis on a sales data to detect trends in the data. From the data, I realised the following;
   The highest sales occured in December.
   The gadgets with the highest sales was Macbook pro laptop.
   The highest sales occured in the city San Francisco.
A further analysis will be carried out on this data using Microsoft Excel to show more trends and draw more insights from the data.
